1. [Sum all numbers in range](https://github.com/kellyky/js_practice/blob/main/algo-practice.js/sum-all-in-range.js)
> We'll pass you an array of two numbers. Return the sum of those two numbers plus the sum of all the numbers between them. The lowest number will not always come first.

2. Diff Two Arrays -- link placeholder
> Compare two arrays and return a new array with any items only found in one of the two given arrays, but not both. In other words, return the symmetric difference of the two arrays. You can return the array with its elements in any order.

3. Mutations - link placeholder
> Return true if the string in the first element of the array contains all of the letters of the string in the second element of the array. For example, ["hello", "Hello"], should return true because all of the letters in the second string are present in the first, ignoring case. The arguments ["hello", "hey"] should return false because the string hello does not contain a y. Lastly, ["Alien", "line"], should return true because all of the letters in line are present in Alien.

4. ]Sum All Odd Fibonacci Numbers
>Given a positive integer num, return the sum of all odd Fibonacci numbers that are less than or equal to num. The first two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence are 1 and 1. Every additional number in the sequence is the sum of the two previous numbers. The first six numbers of the Fibonacci sequence are 1, 1, 2, 3, 5 and 8. For example, sumFibs(10) should return 10 because all odd Fibonacci numbers less than or equal to 10 are 1, 1, 3, and 5.
