/*    NOTES 
 *    
 *    We know num % 1000 =  // tells us if a number is evenly divisible by 1000
 *    We know (num - (num % 1000)/1000 will tell us how many "M"s as thousands to repeat
 *    We'll need to concat an "M" for each thousand
 *    We also know that we'll need to figure out what to do with the Remainder
 *    We know that we can get that remainder with num % 1000
 *    We'll need to declare a variable to keep track of the remainder as we deduct for each Numeral
 *    We'll need a variable (I think) to hold onto the Roman Numeral being built
