/*
 *
 Write a class Vec that represents a vector in 2 space
 - Takes x and y params; these are numbers
 - saves to properties of the same name
 Give Vec 2 methods:
 - plus
 - minus
 These should: 
  - take another vector as a param  
  - return a new vector that has the sum or difference of the two vectors' (this and the parameter) x and y vals
  Add getter property length to prodotype
  Should compute the length of vector - distance of point (x, y) and origin (0, 0)
