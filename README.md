Welcome to my treasure trove of javascript exercises. 

In this early iteration, I'll try to keep it simple. The file will be named after the exercise. I may add comments here. 



At this time, this repo is for 'Roman Numerals' -- Javascript practice. I haven't decided yet whether I'll expand this repo to include the same exercise in other programming languages -- or stay with JS but expand to include other exercises. 

I got this exercise from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises/roman-numerals/) but if you look at their page, they got it from someone else.
