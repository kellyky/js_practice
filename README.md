Hi! This is my README. Not much to see here yet. 

At this time, this repo is for 'Roman Numerals' -- Javascript practice. I haven't decided yet whether I'll expand this repo to include the same exercise in other programming languages -- or stay with JS but expand to include other exercises. 

I got this exercise from [Exercism](https://exercism.org/tracks/javascript/exercises/roman-numerals/) but if you look at their page, they got it from someone else.
